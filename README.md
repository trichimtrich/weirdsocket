# WeirdSocket

A simple python socket server supports both raw tcp and ssl, simultaneously.

Real implementation of multiple techniques to resolve the problem.

## Why?

It came up while I was working on other side project (which is pending now 🤐). Although the problem seems super simple (encapsulate TLS around normal socket? or just resume the handshake phase?), but there is no real article related to this situation. Also other open source projects might already have solved in someway, but you will have to spend days to dig into them.

So I would like to amplify it, and share my little work.

But, why are you here? 🙄
